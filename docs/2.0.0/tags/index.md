The notation inside HTML comments are comment tags or just "tags". Comment tags define how the bot behaves. Regular markdown content outside HTML comments is used to define what the bot says in voice interfaces and what it shows the user in GUI interfaces. Its also used to define inputs accepted from the user. Tags add interactivity and workflow to what would otherwise be a normal markdown page. For instance it adds slot filing (asking questions) and the ability to present content based the user's answers to previous questions - standard parts of a chatbot or web app workflow.
